# Humanoid Animatronic Learning Simulator for Medical Interactive Training (H.A.L. S.M.I.T., or HAL for short)
This GitHub repository contains the code, circuit diagrams, and CAD files for HAL.

The folder titled "HAL" contains all of the Arduino code to control HAL.

The folder titled "MATLAB" contains the code and calculations for the possible Stewart platform neck design. This also includes the resulting plots and .xls files of the servo angles necessary for various movements.

The foler titled "New Neck Test" contains area where Arduino code could be developed for the Stewart platform.

The "WaveFilePlayerV1" folder contains the test file for playing pre-recorded audio from a microSD card in the Teensy using the Audio Library.

Be sure to install the latest version of Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and the Teensy Loader (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html) before uploading the code.

Follow the steps detailed in the manual and note the comments in the official when working on H.A.L.
